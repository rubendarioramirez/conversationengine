There are two licenses, depending on how you use the Unity Conversation Engine. The simple version is:

a) you can freely use this to create your own game, but please mention it in the credits somewhere (e.g. "uses Unity Conversation Engine by Tom Vogt")

b) if you extend, polish, improve or otherwise create a new conversation engine script based on this one and wish to distribute it, then in addition to credits you also have to allow others to do likewise with your new work.
